general things to be done (asuming structs come in a
stream-like thing) both in pcap file parsing and in
live network traffic monitoring
    > IP        |   get protocol - decode packet (TCP or UDP?)
    > IP        |   skip non TCP or UDP packets
    > IP & TCP  |   get source and dest IP and port
    > TCP |   get header and payload length
    >   |   find where the payload is in memory (?)
    >   |   is the packet a retransmit? mark it
    > on exit 
        - print number of (only UDP/TCP, since we cannot know
          the details (IPs and ports) for the rest, since we
          dont decode them) network flows scanned
          and how many are TCP/UDP
          (flows are uniquely identified by the 5 tuple:
            - src_ip
            - src_port
            - dst_ip
            - dst_port
            - protocol
           so many packets to the same IP and port from the
        - total number of packets received including non decoded ones
          how many were TCP UDP
        - total number of bytes in TCP and UDP packets (header and payload
          assumed)


- option -i requires interface name


- option -r requires filename
    - opens that for reading


- argument -f is followed by a filter expression enclosed in double quotes
    - need to apply filter



- option -h prints help
