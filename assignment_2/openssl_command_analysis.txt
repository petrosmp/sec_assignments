openssl                 base command
req                     certificate request and generation utility
-x509                   create a self signed X.509 certificate (instead of requesting it from a CA)
-nodes                  do not encrypt the private key
-days 365               used when -x509 is used to specify how long the certificate is valid for (default 30 days)
-newkey rsa:2048        new cert and new private key. Since RSA is specified, 1024 is the length of the key in bits. For other algorithms we can pass a filename containing parameters
-keyout mycert.pem      where the private key will be written
-out mycert.pem         where the output (the certificate) will be written
